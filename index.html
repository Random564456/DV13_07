                Criminal offences in Australia are often penalised through monetary fines.
                Each state and territory independently administers fines as part of their legal and enforcement system.

                This chart illustrates the distribution of criminal offence fines issued across each month of the year.
                Each data point represents the total number of fines delivered within that month, providing insights
                into
                seasonal or administrative trends in law enforcement.

                Automated camera systems, particularly mobile and fixed cameras, are responsible for the majority of
                traffic fines in Australia, accounting for over 3 million violations combined.
              </p>
              <p>
                In contrast, traditional police-issued fines and other systems like red light or speed cameras
                contribute significantly less, highlighting a strong reliance on automated enforcement.

      <h3>Understanding the Data</h3>
      <p>
        Across Australia, traffic offences are predominantly penalised through monetary fines rather than charges, or
        arrests.
        This data illustrates a consistent trend throughout the year, where each month sees hundreds of thousands of
        fines issued.
      </p>
      <p>
        The steady distribution of fines across all states and months indicates that traffic enforcement is a routine
        part of legal administration,
        often automated through road safety cameras and patrol systems. These financial penalties form the primary
        mechanism for deterring
        offences like speeding, red light violations, and illegal parking.
      </p>
      <p>
        In essence, if you commit a traffic offence anywhere in Australia, you are almost guaranteed to receive a fine â€“
        a system designed
        to maintain public safety through consistent, measurable consequences.
